Multithreading is implemented in Linux userspace by the pthread
library.

Problem Statements:

Write an application that has multiple threads. The number of threads
should be accepted via command line. Of the number provided, half
(rounded off to less if the number is odd) should do the following
continuously:

  * Poll a string variable at random intervals (less than 2 seconds with
    granularity of approximately microseconds) to see if it contains a
    positive value.

The remaining threads should do the following:

  * sleep for random intervals
  * Once awake, write its own name in the string

The program should run continuously, terminating only when someone
presses Ctrl+C at the terminal.
